# `sermon-processor` - Final Manual Audiofile Scrub

You've made it!

Your audio file has been processed, but it still needs a bit of manual touch to
make it perfect. Please follow these steps in Audacity:

1. Trim any excess silences between the clips. The ideal gap between the intro,
   scripture passage, scripture reading, the sermon, and the outro is about 1.5
   seconds (doesn't have to be exact!).

2. Listen carefully for any "bumps" or awkward transitions between the clips.
   These might occur where the audio segments have been stitched together. If
   you find any, try to smooth them out for a seamless listening experience.

3. Finally, pay attention to when the pastor says something like "let's pray" at
   the end of their sermon. The goal is to trim out the pastor's final prayer
   while preserving Rhea's outro segment. This requires careful listening to
   find the exact moment to cut.

4. Upon completing the final steps, export the audio file as a .mp3 with the
   filename "yyyy-mm-dd.mp3" as the final cut to be reviewed.

Remember, a careful ear makes for a polished final product. Take your time, and
don't rush the process. Our listeners will appreciate the attention to detail.

Thank you for helping to create a great listening experience!
